To compile, be in a parent file containing the package + 8Puzzle.txt, then type "javac -d . edu/iastate/cs472/proj1/*.java"
To run, stay in the parent file and type "java edu.iastate.cs472.proj1.PuzzleSolver [filepath of puzzle txt file]"
    For me, the filepath is just "8Puzzle.txt" from the parent folder Project1
