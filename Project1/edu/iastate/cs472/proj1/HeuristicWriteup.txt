The heuristic I am using for when single and double moves are allowed is just the Manhattan Distance / 2.
Given the new problem formulation, we can still relax the same restrictions we did with the Manhattan distance.
However, now there is the potential for double moves.
In an optimal solution, every move is a double move.
Therefore, if every move is a double move, it can be no less than the Manhattan Distance / 2.
Which, we know that the Manhattan Distance is admissible for the problem that contains only single moves.
So, this heuristic is admissible because no matter what, it will never overestimate the number of moves to the goal state.
Even if the optimal solution ends up being all double moves, the Manhattan Distance / 2 will correctly predict the number of moves needed (or less).
